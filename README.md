# BinaryTrees

In these basic problems related to Binary Tree is included such as:
1) Print Binary Tree - In this it just ask for input and print tree in simple way we can't predict who is who's child and root but it will just print your entered tree
2) print Binary Tree Level wise -  In this it will ask for input level wise means first eneter root data than enter it's left child than right child, In this fashion it will ask input for every node and will print in same Fashion.
3) Number of nodes in binary Tree - In this it will take input level wise will print your entered Binary Tree Level Wise and will give you total number of nodes present in your Binary Tree.
4) remove Leaf Node - In this it will remove node which do not have siblings means remove that node who don't have child.
5) Balanced Binary Tree - In these it will check if your entered binry Tree in balanced or not logic is Difference of height of left child and right child's height should be <=1.
